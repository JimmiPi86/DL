# DL
In this repository I have my test projects related to deep learning. 
<h1>Description</h1>
In the included jupyter notebooks I tested the performance of deep networks, I also used a Y-shaped network to test its performance. 
The whole thing, for computational reasons, I trained and tested on a relatively primitive set of MNIST
